"""
Integration test for concurrency leases functionality.

This test verifies that concurrency limits properly create and manage
leases to prevent orphaned concurrency slots when flow runs fail unexpectedly.
The test creates global concurrency limits and verifies lease behavior during
flow execution.

This runs every 5 minutes to provide early warning of concurrency lease issues.
